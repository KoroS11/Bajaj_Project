## 📋 Step-by-Step Process

### 1. **Start the System**
```bash
# Double-click this file:
ULTIMATE_STARTUP.bat
```

### 2. **Open Frontend Interface** 
- Navigate to: `frontend/working_interface.html`
- Should show: "⚠️ Upload Required" status

### 3. **Upload Your PDF Policy Document**
- **Drag & drop** or **click to browse**
- **Supported**: Any PDF insurance policy document
- **Processing**: System will extract:
  - Coverage/inclusions sections
  - Exclusions lists  
  - Waiting periods
  - Policy terms and conditions

### 4. **Verify Upload Success**

## 📄 What Documents Work Best?

### ✅ **Ideal Documents:**
- Insurance policy documents (PDF format)

### ✅ **Document Content Should Include:**

- **Waiting periods** (time requirements)
- **Benefit amounts** (coverage limits)

### ❌ **Won't Work:**
- Non-insurance documents

## 🧪 Test Your Document

### **Sample Test Queries:**
Based on whatever's in YOUR uploaded document:

```
"IVF treatment for 30-year-old woman"

"Cancer treatment benefits"
"Emergency care claim"
"Maternity benefits eligibility"
```

### **Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ **Found in document** → APPROVED with amount/coverage details
