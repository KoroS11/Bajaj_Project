# üîß Decision Consistency Fix - Summary

## üö® ISSUE IDENTIFIED
**Problem**: System was incorrectly rejecting queries that should be approved due to inconsistent mock document selection and flawed decision logic.

## ‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED

### 1. **Unified Mock Document** 
- **Before**: System used different mock documents (IVF-friendly vs. standard)
- **After**: Single balanced mock document used for all queries
- **Coverage**: IVF, fertility treatments, cardiac, cancer, emergency, general medical
- **Exclusions**: Only cosmetic surgery, experimental treatments, non-emergency dental implants

### 2. **Enhanced Waiting Period Logic**
- **Before**: Waiting periods were not properly enforced
- **After**: Smart waiting period checking with clear rejection reasons
- **Example**: IVF requires 2 years, policy held for 1 year = REJECTED with explanation

### 3. **Improved Fallback Logic** 
- **Before**: Generic fallback to general medical coverage
- **After**: Procedure-specific fallback with better reasoning
- **Smart**: Recognizes surgery/treatment terms for general medical coverage

### 4. **Consistent Decision Priority**
1. **Exclusions** (highest priority) ‚Üí REJECTED
2. **Waiting Period Violations** ‚Üí REJECTED with specific reason
3. **Direct Coverage Match** ‚Üí APPROVED
4. **Fuzzy Coverage Match** ‚Üí APPROVED 
5. **General Medical Fallback** ‚Üí APPROVED
6. **No Match** ‚Üí REJECTED

## üß™ TEST THE FIX

### Run Consistency Test:
```bash
python test_decision_consistency.py
```

### Manual Test Cases:
```
‚úÖ SHOULD BE APPROVED:
- "IVF treatment for 30-year-old woman, policy active for 3 years"
- "Heart surgery for 45-year-old male"
- "Cancer chemotherapy treatment"
- "Emergency surgery after accident"

‚ùå SHOULD BE REJECTED:
- "IVF treatment for 25-year-old, policy active for 1 year" (waiting period)
- "Cosmetic surgery for beauty enhancement" (excluded)
- "Experimental gene therapy" (excluded)

‚ö†Ô∏è EDGE CASES:
- "Dental emergency treatment" ‚Üí APPROVED (emergency coverage)
- "Dental implants for cosmetic" ‚Üí REJECTED (non-emergency)
```

## üéØ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR NOW

### Consistent Results:
- Same query = same decision every time
- No random APPROVED/REJECTED switching
- Clear reasoning for all decisions

### Proper Coverage Logic:
- IVF covered after 2-year waiting period
- Cardiac procedures always covered
- Emergency care always covered
- Exclusions properly enforced

### Smart Entity Extraction:
- Age, gender, policy duration detected
- Waiting period compliance checked
- Procedure type classification improved

## üìä VERIFICATION

### Health Check:
- Visit: http://localhost:5000/health
- Should show: `"server_mode": "MOCK"` with consistent behavior

### Frontend Test:
1. Open `frontend/working_interface.html`
2. Try multiple IVF queries
3. Should get consistent APPROVED/REJECTED based on waiting period
4. Try cardiac surgery ‚Üí should always be APPROVED
5. Try cosmetic surgery ‚Üí should always be REJECTED

---

**üéâ RESULT: System now provides consistent, logical decisions based on balanced insurance policy rules!**
