## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **1. Start the System**
```bash
# Double-click this file:
start_intelligent_system.bat
```

### **2. Open the Interface**
```bash
# Open in browser:
frontend/index.html
```

### **3. Test with Sample Queries**
```
46-year-old male, knee surgery in Pune, 3-month-old insurance policy
32M, heart surgery, Mumbai, 1 year policy active
28F, dental treatment, Delhi, 6 months policy duration
```

---

## 🎯 **What It Does**

### **Input**: Structured Query
```
"46M, knee surgery, Pune, 3-month policy"
```

### **Processing**:
1. **Entity Extraction**: Age=46, Gender=M, Procedure=knee surgery, Location=Pune, Duration=3 months
2. **Rule Application**: Check coverage rules, age limits, waiting periods
3. **Decision Making**: Apply business logic and policy constraints
4. **Response Generation**: Create structured JSON with justification

### **Output**: Intelligent Decision
```json
{
  "decision": "approved",
  "amount": 500000,
  "answer": "Yes, knee surgery is covered. Max coverage: ₹5,00,000",
  "justification": {
    "reasoning": ["Age 46 is within limits", "Policy meets waiting period"],
    "clauses_used": ["Coverage rule for knee surgery"]
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**
1. **"Module not found"**: Flask packages installed ✅
2. **"Backend not responding"**: Use `start_intelligent_system.bat`
3. **"Poor entity extraction"**: Use structured format like "46M, knee surgery, Pune, 3-month policy"
4. **"Wrong decisions"**: Check if your rules match the built-in coverage table

### **Test System**
```bash
# Run this to verify everything works:
python test_intelligent_system.py
```
